We've seen how to use `HIElement` to declaratively build Web Components. In addition to the basics of element and attribute definition, `HIElement` also provides a way to declare templates capable of high-performance rendering, and efficient, incremental batched updates. Finally, CSS can easily be associated with an element in a way that leverages core platform optimizations for performance and low memory allocation.

Now that you're familiar with the robust and powerful features of `HIElement`, you're ready to build your own components and apps. But you don't have to start from scratch there either! If you haven't already explored them, check out our [HI Components](../components/getting-started), which provide all the basic UI building-blocks you'd expect in a modern component library. You can also leverage the same adaptive design system that our own components use to enable robust theming throughout all you create. Read more on that in [Styling Components](/docs/design-systems/hi-frame#configuring-components). Finally, you'll want to take advantage of a modern toolset by installing [a powerful editor and plugins](../tools/vscode).
